# MetaLens

## Overview

MetaLens is a Python program designed for image metadata manipulation. It provides features such as metadata extraction, GPS tracing on a browser, metadata editing, and metadata scrubbing to create a clean copy of an image without any metadata. The project supports various metadata formats, including IPTC, EXIF, and XMP. It also leverages external resources such as ngtvspc/EXIF_remover.py, Pillow documentation, and Image module documentation.
